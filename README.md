# AI_Research
This repository is dedicated to my ongoing and future research in AI. It will feature projects, experiments, and code on topics such as mechanistic interpretability, explainable AI, and human-computer interaction. Contributions and collaborations are welcome as we explore the inner workings of neural networks and their practical impacts.
